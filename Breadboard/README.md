# Z-CAM-E1-IO

The cable I'm using to connect the Z CAM E1 to a breadboard.

I have made a couple of cables (I have several breadboards for the E1 going) using ordinary pin headers and plugs I've found on eBay.
 
Finding the plugs have not been easy, as there is scarce info about which type to use. I have found two different, working plugs on eBay, one of which is no longer available and [this one](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/12-x-Mini-USB-Plug-Male-12-Pin-Used-for-SAMSUNG-Product/180396604436), which I'm using right now.
