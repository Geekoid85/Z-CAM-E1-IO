# Z-CAM-E1-IO
Firing an external flash via the Teensy's digital pins.

The Z CAM E1 was never designed to sync with electronic flash and it shows. The major obstacle is the electronic shutter with its slow read-out time. That means that the shutter speed needs to be kept low, in my tests anything faster than about 1/20 second results in dark bands at the upper or lower edges.

The next hindrance is the delay between "pressing the button" to take a picture and the picture actually being taken. The delay is ~150 milliseconds. It's easy to implement a delay as such on an Arduino, but the camera's delay isn't consistent, it changes a couple of milliseconds up and down from shot to shot in an unpredictable manner. It can be worked around by choosing a slow shutter speed and combine that with a small aperture, which calls for stronger flash output, i.e. longer burn times.

Test setup. Bitscope Micro oscilloscope/logic analyzer, breadboard with a Teensy 2.0, batteries and a nice postcard from Spain as focus targets, the camera itself, 5" CVBS monitor and an old analog flash from my Olympus OM film days.

Digital output pin on Teensy 2.0 connects to flash's trigger pin via a transistor. When the Teensy's digital pin goes HIGH, the transistor conducts, pulling the flashs' trigger voltage down and that sets the flash off.

For my tests, I use an old Olympus T-32 flash. I have six of them. I like them a lot, because they are quite powerful in a small package. The reflector can tilt up to 90ยบ and down 7ยบ (for close-ups) and they can be powered from mains AC.  They have a connector on the side that mimics the pins on the foot, making it easy to connect them to each other in a multi-flash setup. Chopping up a cable makes it as easy to connect them to other things :wink:
