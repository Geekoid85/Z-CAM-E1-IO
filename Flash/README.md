# Z-CAM-E1-IO
Controlling the lens focus on the Z CAM E1 through its I/O port and firing an external flash via the Teensy's digital pins..

Digital output pin on Teensy 2.0 connects to flash's trigger pin via a transistor. When the Teensy's digital pin goes HIGH, the transistor conducts, pulling the flashs' trigger voltage down and that sets the flash off.

For my tests, I use an old Olympus T-32 flash. I have six of them. I like them a lot, because they are powerful in a small package. They have a connector on the side that mimics the pins on the foot, making it easy to connect them to each other in a multi-flash setup or to other things :wink: The reflector can tilt up to 90ยบ and down 7ยบ (for close-ups).
